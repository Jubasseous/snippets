  For each method, answer the following tasks:

  1. What is passed to the method?
  2. What does the method return?
  3. What variable is used to traverse the array? 
  4. On first glance, what does the method look like it is supposed to do? 

  5. Now, go through each line and exlplain what each line (or each part of the method) does. 
  6. What is the purpose of the method?

public static double[] traverserOne( int[] arr )
	{
		double[] newArr = new double[arr.length];
		
		for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)
		{
			newArr[i] = ( (double) (arr[i]) );
		}
		
		return newArr;
	}
	
	public static int[] traverserTwo( int[] arr , int n )
	{
		for (int index = 0; index < arr.length; index++)
		{
			arr[index] = ( arr[index] + n );
		}
		
		return arr;
	}
	
	public static int traverserThree( double[] arr )
	{
		int c = 0;
		
		for (int j = 0; j <= arr.length-1; j++)
		{
			if ( arr[j] == 4.0 )
			{
				c++;
